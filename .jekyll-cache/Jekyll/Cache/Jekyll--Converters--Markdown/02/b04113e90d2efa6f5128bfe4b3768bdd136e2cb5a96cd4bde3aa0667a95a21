I"´<hr />

<p>Homeworks are due at the beginning of class one week after they are posted.  Solutions will be posted two days after the homeworks are submitted, and homeworks will be returned a week after they are submitted.</p>

<p>Late policy: NO late homeworks will be accepted (late means anytime after class starts the day the homework is due) unless you have a mindblowingly good excuse - this means a note from someone like a doctor or a Dean.  Rob does not grant extensions.</p>

<p>Collaboration policy: you may discuss the homework with others, but your explanations and derivations must be your own.  Your logic and the <em>significance</em> of your results should also be explained.</p>
