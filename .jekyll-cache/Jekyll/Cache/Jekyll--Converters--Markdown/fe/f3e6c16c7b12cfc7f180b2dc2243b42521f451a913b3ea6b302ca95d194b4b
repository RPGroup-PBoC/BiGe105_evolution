    <td>**Perspective, vision, and preliminaries.** Here we introduce some of the broad philosophical themes that animate our subject and this course. SARS-CoV-2 and the pandemic. Science and life in a global pandemic. Barbara McClintock and a feeling for the organism. Schro Ãàdinger‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat is Life?‚Äù at 75. The physical basis of the living organ- ism. Order of magnitude thinking and street-fighting mathematics. Tom Hanks, Wilson and what we can figure out by pure thought alone. Survey of what it means to be the physics of a subject. Topics we want to do physics to in the study of the living world.
