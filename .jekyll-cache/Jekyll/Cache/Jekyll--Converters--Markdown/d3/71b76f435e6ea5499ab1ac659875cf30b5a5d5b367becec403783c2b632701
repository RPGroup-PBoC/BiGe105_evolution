<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>It is a wonderful time to be thinking about the workings of the living world.  Historic advances in molecular biology, structural biology and the use of biophysical  techniques such as optical traps have provided an unprecedented window on the mechanics of the cell.  The aim of this course is to study the cell and its components using whatever tools we need in order  to make quantitative and predictive statements about cellular life. The main intellectual thread of  the course will be the idea that the type of quantitative data which is becoming routine in biology  calls for a corresponding quantitative modeling framework. The plan of this course is to elucidate  general principles with exciting case studies.</p>

<p>This course takes place on Mondays and Wednesdays in 100 Broad. Lectures are held from 2:30 to 3:55 PM. Check the Syllabus page for the tentative days/times of the makeup classes.</p>
