  Bi/Ge 105 \| Evolution

About: >
  The objective of this course is to use broad brush strokes to paint a picture
  of modern thinking on evolution, both of living organisms and the planet they
  inhabit. The first part of the course will take a decidedly historical and
  naturalistic perspective, focusing on the timeline of evolution (based on the
  geological record of fossils and geochemical signatures) and how the natural
  history of both the inanimate and animate worlds in the hands of Darwin and
  Wallace (and their distinguished predecessors) led to the articulation of the
  tenets of evolution by natural selection as well as a picture of a dynamic
  Earth. This will be followed by an examination of the emergence of modern
  genetics which gave us a molecular picture of variation. Next, we will
  undertake a study of the forces of evolution such as selection, drift,
  migration and mutation and how population genetics provides a quantitative
  framework for examining the interplay between these forces. With these
  preliminaries in hand, we will then turn to a variety of case studies in
  evolution that illustrate the principles of the subject with some of the
  remarkable studies that have been made to test these ideas. We will close
  with a discussion of the great human experiment in which human activities
  have rewritten the story of evolution.
