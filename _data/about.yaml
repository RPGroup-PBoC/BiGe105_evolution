  BE/APh 161 | Physical Biology of the Cell

About: >
  It is a wonderful time to be thinking about the workings of the living world. 
  Historic advances in molecular biology, structural biology and the use of biophysical 
  techniques such as optical traps have provided an unprecedented window on the mechanics of the cell. 
  The aim of this course is to study the cell and its components using whatever tools we need in order 
  to make quantitative and predictive statements about cellular life. The main intellectual thread of 
  the course will be the idea that the type of quantitative data which is becoming routine in biology 
  calls for a corresponding quantitative modeling framework. The plan of this course is to elucidate 
  general principles with exciting case studies.

Where and When:  >
  This course takes place via Zoom. Our first meeting will be Monday, January 4th 2021
  at 2:30 PM, PST. A Zoom link and email has been emailed to you, but please email 
  one of the TAs if you do not have it.
