    <b>Perspective, vision, and preliminaries.</b> Here we introduce some of the
    broad philosophical themes that animate our subject and this course.
    SARS-CoV-2 and the pandemic. Science and life in a global pandemic.
    Barbara McClintock and a feeling for the organism. Schro ̈dinger’s “What
    is Life?” at 75. The physical basis of the living organ- ism. Order of
    magnitude thinking and street-fighting mathematics. Tom Hanks, Wilson and
    what we can figure out by pure thought alone. Survey of what it means to
    be the physics of a subject. Topics we want to do physics to in the study
    of the living world.
