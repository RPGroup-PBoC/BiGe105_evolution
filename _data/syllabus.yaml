      title: Semantics on scale (18:13)
      description: This vignette describes two ways in which we will use the word scale. First, in the spirit of "what sets the scale of X?" and second, how some quantity of interest, such as the diffusion time, scales with some other quantity such as the length over which that scaling occurs.

      titlea: Diffusion - introduction (10:42)
      descriptiona: This vignette introduces diffusion as molecular and cell biology's dynamical null hypothesis. As we will see in subsequent vignettes, like many of the key ideas of physics, there are many different ways to view this subject.
    - urla: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dGGM0v1U9o
      titlea: Diffusion - coin flips (19:15)
      descriptiona: One view of diffusion is as the dynamics that result when independent agents "choose" what they are going to do next by flipping coins. While this observation seems contrived and trivial, it is actually very deep.
    - urla: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1olekmCT0i4
      titlea: Diffusion - continuum theory (22:11)
      descriptiona: As with Toner Tu theory, we can write a field theory for diffusion that culminates in the famed partial differential equation known as the diffusion equation. This vignette describes that theory.

      titlea: Diffusion - master equation (17:46)
      descriptiona: Another very powerful paradigm we will use over and over is that of probabilistic reasoning. Dynamics of probability distributions can be written in the language of master equations and this vignette explains that approach.

      description: This vignette is a very concrete case study of reaction-diffusion equations as they pertain to anterior-posterior patterning in the fly. Note that part of the fun of taking this model seriously is that we see that it falls quantitatively short of accounting for the experimental data, raising the need to consider further refinements.
