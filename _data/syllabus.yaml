    <h3>2. Scales and Scaling in Physical Biology</h3>
    </header> 
  videos1:
    - url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeievEzAlKU
      title: Semantics on scale (18:13)
      description: This vignette describes two ways in which we will use the word scale. First, in the spirit of "what sets the scale of X?" and second, how some quantity of interest, such as the diffusion time, scales with some other quantity such as the length over which that scaling occurs.
    - url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlxadiuIRgk
      title: Scaling of diffusion time (16:47)
      description: This vignette develops one of the most important rules of thumb in all of science - how we estimate the time that diffusive processes will take.
    - url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lltMsmF0yGo&t=1s
      title: Nucleolar scaling (23:45)
      description: This vignette starts with an introduction to scaling relations between organelle size and cell size and then turns to the study of how the size of the nucleolus scales with nuclear size in the developing C. elegans embryo.
    - url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMzGJWAyBqI
      title: Mitochondrial surface volume (18:58)
      description: This vignette explores the idea that when cells get too large, the plasma membrane is no longer large enough to contain enough ATP synthases to provide enouch ATP for the cellular interior.

    - url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA8Xhj3cSwI
      title: Osmotic pressure (14:11)
      description: When there is a concentration difference across a membrane such as a frog's skin, water will flow as a result of osmotic pressure. Here we use simple free energy arguments to explain osmotic pressure.
    - url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThHDJ_sOHxU
      title: Linear transport laws (20:35)
      description: This vignette discusses one of the most powerful tools in the physicochemical arsenal for working out the dynamics of how systems approach the maximum entropy (equilibrium) state. Here our focus is on the law of water transport due to osmotic pressure, a key player in the response of frogs to being in salt water.
    - url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RHIiKgDwxo
      title: Frog osmotic shock (15:36)
      description: This vignette writes the differential equation for water flow out of an osmotically shocked frog and uses that to estimate the time for the frog to dry out.

      title: Origins of field theory (27:11)
      description: This vignette introduces the idea of field theory, with roots that date back to the early days of mechanics. After a historical introduction, we examine the nature of field theories of matter.

      title: Toner Tu theory intro (16:17)
      description: This brief vignette shows how Toner and Tu developed a field theoretic description of animal motions culminating in the famed Toner Tu partial differential equations.

     <h3>4. Diffusive Dynamics</h3>

  videos2: 
    - urla: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4f9lGdDE8w
      titlea: Diffusion - introduction (10:42)
      descriptiona: This vignette introduces diffusion as molecular and cell biology's dynamical null hypothesis. As we will see in subsequent vignettes, like many of the key ideas of physics, there are many different ways to view this subject.
    - urla: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dGGM0v1U9o
      titlea: Diffusion - coin flips (19:15)
      descriptiona: One view of diffusion is as the dynamics that result when independent agents "choose" what they are going to do next by flipping coins. While this observation seems contrived and trivial, it is actually very deep.
    - urla: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1olekmCT0i4
      titlea: Diffusion - continuum theory (22:11)
      descriptiona: As with Toner Tu theory, we can write a field theory for diffusion that culminates in the famed partial differential equation known as the diffusion equation. This vignette describes that theory.
    - urla: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahoqCKxRZU0
      titlea: Diffusion - master equation (17:46)
      descriptiona: Another very powerful paradigm we will use over and over is that of probabilistic reasoning. Dynamics of probability distributions can be written in the language of master equations and this vignette explains that approach.

    - url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b90lCVjJ4jY
      title: I wonder - pattern formation (17:22)
      description: This vignette introduces the idea of biological pattern as a prelude to the mathematical exploration of these phenomena using the twin concepts of positional information and the Turing instability.
    - url: https://youtu.be/wr1UTL7MixA
      title: Continuum theory protocol (20:05)
      description: This vignette describes how continuum field theories can be used in a myriad of different settings including for pattern formation.
    - url: https://youtu.be/k3lRI0M7mV8
      title: Paradigms for patterning (11:55)
      description: This vignette describes two distinct classes of models for thinking about the emergence of patterns - the concept of positional information and the self-organization properties of Turing patterns.
    - url: https://youtu.be/NpnUSjHx2mM
      title: On positional information (12:22)
      description: This vignette gives a more detailed introduction to the Wolpert idea of positional information.
    - url: https://youtu.be/zTJJm7RNzhg
      title: Positional information - reaction-diffusion equation (19:50)
      description: This vignette shows how to use the continuum theory protocol to derive a beautiful generalization of the diffusion equation that accounts for protein degradation as well.
    - url: https://youtu.be/yBasfKv88aY
      title: Positional inforamtion - the French flag model (11:12)
      description: This vignette is a very concrete case study of reaction-diffusion equations as they pertain to anterior-posterior patterning in the fly. Note that part of the fun of taking this model seriously is that we see that it falls quantitatively short of accounting for the experimental data, raising the need to consider further refinements.

      titlea: Life as defiance - Introduction (29:28)

    - urla: https://youtu.be/oqWTeEADpUM
      titlea: Statistical mechanics protocol (18:49)
      descriptiona: This vignette gives a formal but superficial introduction to statistical mechanics. We need this introduction here because these tools will help us compute entropic forces when DNA is pulled on by optical tweezers.
    - urla: https://youtu.be/kC-I4H-EJXc
      titlea: Entropic elasticity DNA (44:53)
      descriptiona: This vignette shows how we can use statistical mechanics to carefully understand our first concrete example of an entropic force, namely, the way that DNA resists being stretched.

      titlea: Interlude on Taylor series (17:51)
      descriptiona: This vignette provides a powerful and important mathematical tool that we will use repeatedly in a huge variety of different situations. In the current context it will serve us in understanding how Hooke's law emerges in DNA pulling experiments.
