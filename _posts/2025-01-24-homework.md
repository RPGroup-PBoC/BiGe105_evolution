Unless otherwise noted, homework assignments will be posted here on Wednesday afternoons, and are due the following Wednesday at 12:30pm (half an hour before class). Extension requests have to be sent 6 hours before homework is due, everything after that will be regarded as late. Late submission are deducted 10% of points, increasing by 10% for every hour after 3pm.

Don't forget that there will also be occasional reading discussions on Canvas.

To submit your work, please email a PDF to Tom (tom[at]caltech[dot]edu), Kian (kian[at]caltech[dot]edu) and Eli (egrossmn[at]caltech[dot]edu) with the subject line "[Bi/Ge 105] HW # - FirstName LastName", substituting the assignment number and your actual name. Please also add your name to every file that you submit, this makes our lives a lot easier.
